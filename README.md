- 👋 Hi, I’m @kskakaria
- 👀 I’m interested in how variation of neural architecture constrains the set of computational solutions and informs the path of learning from short timescales to evolutionary heritability.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning github and machine learning theories and how those principals could be degenerated in biological systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on constrained neural networks with real neural connectivity and biological sources of error 
- 📫 How to reach me: kyobi@caltech.edu, kyobisk@gmail.com
